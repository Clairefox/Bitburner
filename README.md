These are scripts that I have created and use for the game Bitburner!
You can play the game on Steam or here via web: https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/

In playing this game, I try my best to write my own scripts first then seek inspiration from other's work. The game is less fun if I'm just copying someone else's stuff to run...
